    <button onclick="alert('Hello World!')">Click Me!</button> 
    <!-- Method 1-->
    <!-- This solution is less than ideal because we’re cluttering our HTML with JavaScript. 
        Also, we can only have 1 “onclick” event per element.-->

    <button id="btn">Also CLICK me!</button>
    <!-- Method 2-->
    <!-- This is a little better. We’ve moved the JS out of the HTML and into a JS file, but we still have the problem that a DOM element can only have 1 “onclick” property.-->

    <button id="bttn">No no no.. Click ME!</button>
    <!-- Method 3-->
    <!-- Now, we maintain separation of concerns, and we also allow multiple event listeners if the need arises. Method 3 is much more flexible and powerful, though it is a bit more complex to set up.-->
